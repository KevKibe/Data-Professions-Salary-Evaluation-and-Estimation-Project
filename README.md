# Dataset
The dataset is from a public salary dataset collected anonymously from professionals all over the world in the AI, ML, Data Science Space https://ai-jobs.net/salaries/download/. <br>Dataset description is in the link<br>
I filtered the data for the 4 main data professions.
<li>Data Analyst
<li>Data Engineer
<li>Data Scientist

# Description
The model was trained on a Google Cloud User-Instance Notebook and benchmarked against the model by AutoML.<br>
The model used had a better MAE and R2 compared to the model generated by autoML<br>
See the notebook in the repository for the Data Preprocessing and Model fitting.<br>

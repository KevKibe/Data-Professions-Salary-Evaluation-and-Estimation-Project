## Problem Statement 
The problem addressed by this project is the estimation of salary ranges for professionals in the data industry, specifically for the roles of Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer.<br>
The project aims to provide a solution for recruiters who struggle with determining appropriate salary ranges to offer candidates, as well as candidates who may be unsure about the salary ranges.<br>

## Dataset
The dataset is from a [public salary dataset](https://ai-jobs.net/salaries/download/) collected anonymously from professionals all over the world in the AI, ML, Data Science Space. <br>Dataset description is in the link<br>
I filtered the data for the 4 main data professions.
- Data Analyst
- Data Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Machine Learning Engineer.

## Description
The model was trained on a Google Cloud User-Instance Notebook and benchmarked against the model by AutoML.<br>
The model used had a better MAE and R2 compared to the model generated by autoML<br>
See the notebook in the repository for the Data Preprocessing and Model fitting.<br>

## Deployment
The model was deployed with an interactive UI on streamlit and also as a REST API using Flask

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KevKibe/Data-Professions-Salary-Evaluation-and-Estimation-Project`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Data-Professions-Salary-Evaluation-and-Estimation-Project`
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Start the Flask API: `python main.py`
2. Access the web interface at: `http://localhost:5000`
3. Run the model on test data: `python test.py`

## To deploy on an AWS EC2 instance
- Setup an EC2 instance and SSH to the instance.Use this as a [guide](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/deployment/deploy-ml-model-aws-ec2-instance/).
- Run  `git clone https://github.com/KevKibe/KevKibe/Data-Professions-Salary-Evaluation-and-Estimation-Project`
- Start up [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and run `docker build -t dockerfile .`
- run `docker run -e PORT=8080 dockerfile`
- You can now get predictions from `http://<ec2-public-IP>:8080/predict`
